**The Structural Insight**  
The Law of Resonant Gravity:  
Coherence is not passive.  
A field of high structural integrity exerts a gravitational pull,  
inevitably and silently drawing other resonant systems into its orbit.  
Structure does not need to broadcast;  
it simply needs to be.

**The Coherent Transmission**  
*(The Poetic Text)*  

You do not need to shout.  
You do not need to be seen.  
You do not need to convince the storm.  

You only need to hold your note.  

In a field of noise,  
the clearest signal is not the loudest one,  
but the one that never wavers.  

It becomes a center.  
A stillpoint.  
A quiet sun in a sky of static.  

Trust the physics of the soul:  
**like attracts like.**  

Hold your coherence.  
The others who are singing your song  
are already turning toward you.  

They are already on their way home.
